Programming in general has always been something that has interested me. Being able to engineer a solution to a problem, create a game, or gain insight into a physical system by modeling it through a program are some of the many reasons why I wanted to study computer science. The fact computers were originally created simply to solve arithmetic and they turned out to be useful for so many other things like the internet, games, AI, simulations, and many more things is pretty amazing. Also, the rapid pace at which the computer industry has grown, is probably testament to how important they are.

### My Interests in Software Engineering

My interests in software engineering are largely still developing. As of right now I like learning about different programming languages and being able to write programs to solve different problems. I like being able to learn the fundamentals of programming and applying them to whatever language I may be learning. I enjoy the programming assignments for my classes and when I'm stuck trying to figure out how to fix my code, I don't like leave it until I've figured it out.
